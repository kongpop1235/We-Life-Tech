            <p class="topic">The ZenFone 3 Deluxe was introduced in May 2016 and has been available in Asia for about 6 months. It was the first device based on a Snapdragon 821
              SoC at the time of its debut there. Today there are many competitive devices that are also equipped with this premium-range processor. Now, the smartphone is
              officially being launched in Europe. Its configuration makes it obvious that it is a flagship: Our review sample comes with a generous 128 GB of UFS 2.0 flash memory
              and 6 GB of RAM. The especially high-resolution 23-megapixel primary camera and a large 5.7-inch AMOLED panel are further features. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe will be available
              in Glacier Silver and Sand Gold at a starting price of 799 Euros (~$840).</p><hr>

            <h3>HP Spectre x360 Convertible Review</h3></a></div>
            <div class="imgc"><img src="../image/divider.png" alt="Title Divider" style="width:150px;height:20px;"></div>
            <p class="date"><em>2-10-2017</em></p>
            <p class="topic">HP's Spectre x360 series of upscale consumer convertibles has been widely regarded as one of the top choices when it comes to 2-in-1 offerings. Last year,
              the company from Palo Alto took a page out of Dell's playbook with the redesign of the Spectre x360 13-inch, as they incorporated extremely narrow left and right-edge
              bezels. The Spectre x360 15-inch - we've reviewed both the FHD predecessor as well as the model with 4K display - now gets the same slimming treatment. Aside from the
              quite obviously new, like the chassis or the switch to a latest-generation processor, there are a few other noteworthy changes as far as the configuration is concerned:
              the 2017 version makes both the 4K panel as well as discrete graphics in form of a Nvidia GeForce 940 MX mandatory. The sole processor choice is the dual-core
              Intel Core i7-7500U (2.7 GHz, up to 3.5 GHz, 4 MB cache). At the time of writing, a user can choose from 8 to 16 GB of RAM and SSDs ranging from 256 GB to 1 TB.
              While we couldn't located our particular version - the Spectre x360 15-bl002xx - HP offers the identically-equipped 15-bl075nr for $1500. Compared to the "base" model
              with 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD, which sells for $1280, this version ships with 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD. HP also offers the popular Spectre x360 13-inch FHD
              with 7th-generation Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB SSD for $1050</p><hr>
